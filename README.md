# APS

A simple local file manager app that represents a JSON tree structure as a file system of files
and folders using React.js and allied tooling which might include Typescript, Redux and so on.
### Need to have -
1. Data Handling/State Management - Users should be able to create(upload), edit (filename), delete files and folders. - Context API or Redux or any state management library of choice
2. Routing - Each folder should have a unique route like "home/user/Downloads/App.js" based on their node position.
3. As a User I should be able select multiple assets
4. As a User I should have and option to view files/folders in a collapsible/expandable cascading view
5. As a User I should have the ability to rename and download files
6. As a User I should be able to search the file structure
7. As a User I should be able to see more info about the files in a popup
8. As a User, all the files should be having file icons of the file type.

### Nice to have -
1. Unit test cases

### Notes:
1. Use a dummy JSON that can be used to represent the file system.
2. Not necessary to build backend APIs, just make use of the file blobs in component state.
3. The code should be clean and of production quality.
